- Adding project structure
- Adding library style project
- Creating initial tests. (Not sure yet how to create full functional tests without exposing PII)
- Maybe creating local untracked file exposing this values. Or
    mocking the api calls.
- Initial lib implementation at icbc/road_test.py contains first functions such
as:
    - Login
    - Fetch available spots with two types of grouping [Day of Month,
    and day of week]
    - Unfinished implementation of lock appointment code
